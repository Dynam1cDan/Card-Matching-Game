# Card-Matching-Game
How to play: Run the "GameBoard.java" class to start the game.

Objective: This is a simple card matching game. The game will start with a board full of grey "cards" that will be turned
over when clicked to reveal the flip-side's color. There is a set amount of colored pairs that must be matched. To match
a pair of cards, turn over two cards in a row that have the same color. If the colors match, the two cards will remain
flipped over. If the cards colors do not match, both cards will flip back over. You can flip as many cards as you like.
You will when the game once all of the cards are flipped over and every pair has been matched. The game will then print
a congratulatory message, and tell you how many clicks it took for you to win the game.
